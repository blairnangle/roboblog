Automated blog post writing using the Open AI API.

## Mechanism

1. Come up with a pseudorandom promptâ€”this should change frequently!
2.
   1. Randomly choose an Open AI model
   2. use the Completions API to generate the body of the blog post
3. Use the `PyGithub` library to create a new blog post in the `blairnangle/blairnangle-dot-com` repo (to be displayed at [blairnangle.com/generative](https://blairnangle.com/generative)) with appropriate front matter and footer

## Usage

## Authentication

### Open AI

Generate an API key and saved it as a GitHub Secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Note that a paid Open AI account will be required once you are beyond the three-month free trial.

### GitHub

Create a fine-grained personal access token. The token needs to have the following permissions:

- Read access to metadata
- Read and Write access to code and commit statuses

Store the token as a GitHub Secret named `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Secrets cannot have the `GITHUB_` prefix).
